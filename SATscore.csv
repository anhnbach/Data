\1\Possible scores on each SAT section range from 200 to 800, for a total possible score of 400 to 1600.;
\2\Members of the graduating class who had taken the SAT as a percentage of all students who graduated in that school year. State percentages were calculated by the College Entrance Examination Board based on the number of high school graduates in each state as projected by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). The total percentage for the United States was calculated by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) based on NCES projections of the total number of U.S. high school graduates.;
NOTE: The SAT was completely redesigned in 2016. The new SAT was first administered in March of 2016. This table reflects 2018 through 2023 high school graduates who took the new SAT during high school. The data in this table do not factor in performance on the old SAT, and the data for 2017 set a new baseline for future year-to-year comparisons. If a student took the new SAT more than once, the most recent score on each section is used, along with the student's most recent responses to the SAT questionnaire. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.;
